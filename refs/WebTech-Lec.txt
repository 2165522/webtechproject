WWW - World Wide Web
	- collection of web resources & applications: applications that can make us access web resources by the use of the internet.
1989 - sir Tim Berners Lee
	 - He Works at CERN - HTTP, HTML, URL - provides the addressing of resources
	 - created Web just to be able to share the researchers of the other scientist.
WAIS - Wide Area Information Server 
	 - Collection of server
GOPHER
Types of Applications
	- Client / Server
		- They host web resources
		- wait for client to give request resources
	Spiders - app that crawl the web
	Internet - Global network of networks

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
	- Application layer communications protocol used to access resources on the WWW
	- invented bt Tim Berners - Lee of CERN in 1989
	- jointly developed by the W3C & the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
Version History
	- HTTP 0.9 (1991)
	- HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, May 1996)
	- HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 Jan 1997, RFC 2616 Jun 1999), (RFC 7230-7235(Jun 2014)
	- HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)
HTTP Fundamentals
	- HTTP is based on a client server achitecture
		servers
			origin servers
			proxy servers, gateway, tunnels
	-clients, a.k.a user agents (UA):
		web browser, web crawlers/spiders, other end user tools & applications.
	- HTTP uses a request response standard protocol
		- the client sends an HTTP request message to the server.
		- the server processes the request & replies with an HTTP response message.

HTTP is stateless communications protocol
	servers do not keep information about clients in between request.
HTTP resources are identified using URLs, or more specially, HTTP URLs
	- scheme (HTTP/HTTPS)
	- authority
		- user information/authentication credentials(deprecated)
		- host
	- Domain name(resolved to an IPAddress using DNS) of the server where the resource resides will be created
		- port number
	- Path to resource (resolved relative to the document root on the server)
	- May refer to a static/dynamic resource
	- Typically  provided as key = value pairs, with ampersand(&) separators between key value pairs
		may be URL - Encoded
	- Fragment identifier
HTTP Request Message
	- Request Line (CRLF - terminated line consisting of three spaces separated values)
		- Method
		- Request
		- Protocol Version

		
GET 
HEAD - similar to GET but doesn't send message body
	- returns onlu the status line & message headers returned by a GET request, without the message body
POST - Typically used in submitting HTML Form Data
PUT - Create or replace the state of target request.
DELETE - remove the association between the target resource 
OPTIONS - request information about the communication options available for the target resources.
TRACE - requests a remote, application level loop back of the request message.
	- Typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request/response.
CONNECT - request the establishment of a tunnel.

METHOD PROPERTIES GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE
	- Safe Methods - client does not request & does not expect, any state change on the origin server as a result of applying the method to a target resource.
	- Idempotent Method - intended effect on the server if multiple identical request with the method is the sane as the effect of a single such request
		- GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELET
	- Cachable Methods - no message because it is already cached.
		- indicates that the response to a method is allowed to be stired for future use.

HTTP Extensions
	- HTTP can be extended by defining new request methods, message headers, and/or status codes, and then implementing sewers and/or clients that make use of the new functionality.
		-e.g WebDAV (RFC 4918)
			Request Methods =  PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, TOKEN.
	Overwrite Timeout
		- Status CODES
			(207) Multi-Status, (422) Unprocessable Entity, (423) locked, (424)

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
	- Language used to work up documents (i.e web pages) in the world wide web
	- application of SGML
	historically, HTML was used to specify the structure & content of the web pages as well as their presentation
	- initially developed at CERN, then the IETF, then the W3C & then also the WHATWG
	version History

					introduced deprecation of presentational elements & attributes in favor of styke sheets
					-strict, transitional, frameset DTDs
		XHTML
			- reformulation of HTML in XML
			- intended to facilitate the introduction of new HTML elements and/or attributes, provide interopeability between HTML & XML based system and leverage the use of XML tools in creating, editing, & parsing HTML
			- sought to move the internet - content dev't community from the dats of malformed, non-standard
			-XHTML 1.0 (W3C recommendation, Jab 2000)
			-HTML 1.1 Module-based XHTML (W3C Recommendation, May 2001)
		HTML 5 
			- arose from the effort to evolve HTML (instead of replacing it) to address backward compatibility issues that hindered the adaption of XHTML, as well as to address the emerging needs of modern web applications
			- work on HTML5 was initially undertaken by the WHATWG in 2004, with the W3C signifying interest to participate in the effort in 2006; the first draft of HTML5 was published in 2008 (edited by Ian
			- HTML5 incorporated specifications from HTML existing APIs & introduced new APIs as well
		HTML5 (W3C Recommendation, Oct 2014)
		HTML5.1 (W3C Recommendation, Nov 2016)
		HTML5.2 (W3C Recommendation, Dec 2017)
		HTML Living Standards (WHATWG)
	HTML document structure 
		- version information	 
		- root element (HTML)
		- declarative header section containing document metadata delimited by the head element 
		
		DOM-Document Object Model -provide hierarchical structure
		
		document body containing the document's actual content delimited bu either the body element or the frameset element (obsolute in HTML5)

		- Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE)
		
		- Tags 
		- Content 
			- Content Models
			- Void elements
		- Attributes & Attribute Values (HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0)
